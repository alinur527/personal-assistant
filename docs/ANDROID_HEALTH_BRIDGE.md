# Xiaomi Watch 4 Android Health Bridge

## Architecture

```text
Xiaomi Watch 4
-> Mi Fitness on Samsung Galaxy S23+
-> Android Health Connect, when Mi Fitness publishes the record
-> LifeOS Android bridge or manual/import fallback
-> POST https://archlinux.tail2492c9.ts.net/api/health/ingest
-> Supabase health_metrics
-> TMA Health, Telegram /health, and Obsidian Health
```

LifeOS does not depend on Samsung Health and does not scrape the Mi account.
Health Connect permissions and the per-user health session token stay on the phone. The
backend receives only normalized daily metrics.

## Health Connect Records

The bridge should request only the records the user grants:

- `StepsRecord`
- `SleepSessionRecord`
- `HeartRateRecord`
- `ExerciseSessionRecord`
- `TotalCaloriesBurnedRecord`
- `ActiveCaloriesBurnedRecord`
- `WeightRecord`
- `OxygenSaturationRecord`

Aggregate records per local day in `Asia/Qyzylorda`. Start with manual sync;
add scheduled WorkManager sync only after Xiaomi/Mi Fitness record availability
is verified on the Samsung Galaxy S23+.

## API Contract

```json
{
  "date": "2026-06-07",
  "source": "xiaomi_health_connect",
  "device": "Xiaomi Watch 4",
  "timezone": "Asia/Qyzylorda",
  "metrics": [
    { "type": "steps", "value": 8200, "unit": "steps" },
    { "type": "sleep_minutes", "value": 420, "unit": "min" },
    { "type": "resting_heart_rate", "value": 62, "unit": "bpm" },
    { "type": "active_energy_kcal", "value": 450, "unit": "kcal" }
  ],
  "raw": {}
}
```

Send the per-user token only in the `Authorization: Bearer <health-session-token>` header:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://archlinux.tail2492c9.ts.net/api/health/ingest" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIFEOS_HEALTH_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  --data @health.json
```

The API validates metric types and source, then upserts idempotently by
`user_id, metric_date, metric_type, source`.

## Manual And Import Fallbacks

Telegram manual entry:

```text
/health_log steps:8000 sleep:7h rhr:62 weight:70.5 mood:7 energy:6
```

For exports that cannot be read through Health Connect, normalize JSON or CSV
locally and send with source `import_json` or `import_csv`. Do not upload phone
tokens or Mi account credentials to Supabase.

## Troubleshooting

- Mi Fitness has the metric but LifeOS does not: check whether Mi Fitness
  actually published that record to Health Connect.
- Empty TMA Health: use `/health_sources`, then test `/health_log`.
- HTTP 401: the health session token is missing, expired, or not signed by `LIFEOS_HEALTH_INGEST_JWT_SECRET`, or
  a per-user Bearer token issued by `POST /api/tma/health/ingest-token`.
- HTTP 400: inspect the response for an unsupported source, metric type, date,
  or value.
